        <p class="intro">
            I am Ian Mathews, a graduate student at BYU pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on water resource engineering. 
            My life has included experiences as a firefighter, night0-club bouncer, and medical team member for downhill mountain bike tours. These diverse roles 
            have shaped my passion for learning and experiencing new adventures.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
            My career goals include obtaining my Professional Engineer (PE) license and working on projects to mitigate flooding risks and design sustainable water systems. 
            I aspire to take on leadership roles in the industry, focusing on innovative solutions that benefit both people and the environment. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, 
            snowboarding, pickleball, and spending time with friends. Something I am looking forward to in 2025 is a family trip to Italy this summer.
